üåê NETWORK ACCESS TROUBLESHOOTING

If other devices can't connect to your PassPrint website:

‚úÖ 1. CHECK WIFI NETWORK
- Make sure all devices are on the SAME WiFi network
- Phone and computer must be connected to the same router

‚úÖ 2. FIND YOUR IP ADDRESS
- The launcher shows your IP when it starts
- Or open Command Prompt and type: ipconfig
- Look for "IPv4 Address" starting with 192.168

‚úÖ 3. FIREWALL SETTINGS
- Windows Firewall might block the connection
- Allow Python through Windows Firewall:
  * Search: "Windows Defender Firewall"
  * Click "Allow an app through firewall"
  * Find Python and check both boxes

‚úÖ 4. TEST CONNECTION
- On your computer: http://localhost:8000 (should work)
- On other devices: http://YOUR_IP:8000 (replace YOUR_IP with actual IP)

‚úÖ 5. ALTERNATIVE METHOD
- If network doesn't work, use a USB drive
- Copy the entire passprint-website folder to USB
- Open index.html directly on other computers

üì± QUICK TEST:
1. Start the server on your computer
2. On your phone, open browser
3. Type: http://YOUR_COMPUTER_IP:8000
4. Should see the PassPrint website

üîß IF STILL NOT WORKING:
- Try disabling VPN
- Check if hotspot is being used
- Restart router if necessary
- Try connecting devices directly to same router

The server IS working - it's just a network configuration issue!
